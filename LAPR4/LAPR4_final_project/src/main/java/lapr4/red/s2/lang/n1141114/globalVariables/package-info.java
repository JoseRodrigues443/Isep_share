 * Technical documentation regarding the user story LANG02.2: Global Variables. 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Requirement</b><p>
 * Statement:<p>
 * It should be possible to define a global variable using the "@" before the variable. <p>
 * It should be possible to assign a value to a global variable when the variable is referred for the first time using the assign operator.<p>

 * <p>
 * <b>Notes:</b><p>
 * 
 * This analysis is a very simple view of the creation of the global variable. 
 * Is also demonstrates how we can assign a value to a global variable.
 
 * <b>Tests</b><p>
 * This should include not only unit tests (e.g., class-oriented tests) but also use case tests (e.g., like in the TDD approach). <p>
 *
 * <b>Test1:</b> GlobalVariableAccessDifferentCells<p>
 * There should be a simple test that should verify if the user can access different a global variable from different points.<p>
 * 
 * <b>Design</b><p>
 * First model regarding the design.
