    note right of connManager
        To understand the Extension
        Manager, there is already a
        diagram on network package called
        "IPC01.1_Extension Manager start up"
        the difference to this is the object used
        since the chat uses Messages and not Cells.
    end note
	
    connManager -> ui : notify(message);
    note left of connManager
        Using the Observer pattern
        the extension notifies the
        ui that there is a new message
        to show.
    end note
