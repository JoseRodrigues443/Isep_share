/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story Core01.2 - Auto-description of Extensions
 * <br/>
 *<h2>1. Description</h2>
 * 
 * Extensions should have associated metadata. Particularly, extensions should have a version number, a
 * name and a description. Cleansheets should display to the user the metadata of the extensions before
 * loading them. The user should be able to cancel the loading of an extension and also to select the version
 * of the extension to be loaded (if there are more than one).

 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <h2>2. Requirement</h2>
 * This use case allows the user to load or unload a given extension.
 * 
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
 * 
 * Initially, the user is presented with a list of all loaded and unloaded extensions in the system. 
 * Then, he has to choose an extension in order to load/unload it. As soon as there is a selected extension, he is presented 
 * with her description and versions.
 * After that, if the user wants to proceed the process, he may select "Load" or "Unload" button, so that the changes take effect.
